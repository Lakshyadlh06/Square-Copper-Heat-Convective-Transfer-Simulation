# Square-Copper-Heat-Convective-Transfer-Simulation
This project models steady-state heat transfer in a square copper domain using the Heat Transfer in Solids physics interface in COMSOL Multiphysics.
The simulation applies a combination of Heat Flux and Thermal Insulation boundary conditions to study temperature distribution and thermal gradients within the copper plate.

The result provides insight into how heat propagates through copper when subjected to localized heating and insulated boundaries—useful in electronics cooling, thermal management, and material design.
